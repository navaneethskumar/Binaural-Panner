# Binaural-Panner
The Binaural Panner is a project I built to create an immersive 3D audio experience using SOFA files and HRIR data. I’ve always been fascinated by spatial audio, and this tool allows me to place sound sources at any point in a 360-degree space with control over both azimuth and elevation. Using the MIT KEMAR Normal Pinna dataset, I wrote algorithms to map specific positions to the closest HRIRs, which I then use to convolve with input audio for left and right ear channels. The result is binaural audio that feels much more natural and immersive.

To make it user-friendly, I created a simple GUI with Python’s Tkinter, where users can easily load SOFA and audio files, adjust the spatial parameters with sliders, and then save the output. This project not only helped me dive deeper into audio signal processing, but it also gave me a chance to work on a tool that could be useful in VR, gaming, and even music production—anything where 3D audio really adds to the experience.
